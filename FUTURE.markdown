Let's try not to be *ningas-kugon*, alright?

- dreamweaver (currently handling)
- aoc-hs (memory issues suck tho, in that case, should've used Rust instead and use Haskell for Project Euler?)
- [La antigua escritura filipina](https://archive.org/details/aps6594.0001.001.umich.edu/) and a website on it: multilingual issues abound
- Online books for learning mathematics and Spanish in the Filipino langauge (oh boy that's gonna be a project: synthesizing front-end webtech and pedagogy)
