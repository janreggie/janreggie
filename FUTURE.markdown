Let's try not to be *ningas-kugon*, alright?

- Try reading djvulibre-cpp first to understand how C++ works, and try modernizing it
- [b3DS](https://github.com/b1k/b3DS) and modernize to Go
  - Why modernize? Because why not. Also readability and w/e
  - A general library for 3DS files in Go (or Rust, maybe, because it is language of ✨ the future ✨)
- [La antigua escritura filipina](https://archive.org/details/aps6594.0001.001.umich.edu/) and a website on it: multilingual issues abound
  - Generalization: a **framework** to read literary works of multiple languages at once. Think of _Cuentos de Balmori_ or those books for kids in EN/TGL. In additon, have a way to divide sentences into several parts, e.g., "Voy | al | cine" -> "I'm going | to the (m.) | cinema"
- Online books for learning mathematics and Spanish in the Filipino langauge (oh boy that's gonna be a project: synthesizing front-end webtech and pedagogy)
